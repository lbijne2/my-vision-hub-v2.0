### 4. Environment Variables

Add the following environment variables to your `.env.local` file:

```

### 5. Getting the Database ID

1. Open your Agents database in Notion
2. Click the "Share" button in the top right
3. Click "Copy link"
4. The database ID is the part after the last `/` and before the `?` in the URL
5. Example: `https://notion.so/workspace/1234567890abcdef` ‚Üí `1234567890abcdef`

### 6. Content Structure

For each agent page:

1. **Page Title**: The agent name (e.g., "Clinical Note Summarizer")
2. **Page Body**: Write the full markdown content here - this will be converted to HTML and displayed on the agent detail page
3. **Properties**: Fill in all the required properties listed above

### 7. Example Agent Entry

### 8. Testing the Integration

1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `/agents` to see the agents list
3. Click on an agent to view its detail page
4. Verify that the markdown content is properly rendered
5. Check that related content (projects, blog posts, milestones) appears in the sidebar

### 9. Troubleshooting

**No agents showing up?**
- Check that the `Published` checkbox is checked for your agents
- Verify your `NOTION_API_KEY` and `NOTION_AGENTS_DB_ID` are correct
- Check the browser console for any error messages

**Content not rendering?**
- Make sure you have content in the page body (not just in the Description property)
- Verify the `notion-to-md` package is installed: `npm install notion-to-md`

**Related content not showing?**
- Ensure your other databases (Projects, Blog Posts, Milestones) are properly configured
- Check that the relation properties are correctly set up

### 10. Migration from JSON

If you're migrating from the existing `agents.json` file:

1. Create a new page in your Agents database for each agent in the JSON file
2. Copy the content from the `content` field to the page body
3. Fill in all the properties based on the JSON data
4. Set `Published` to true for agents you want to display
5. Update any related content links as needed

The application will automatically fall back to the JSON data if Notion is not configured or if there are any errors.
