    "content": "The future of work isn't about humans versus AIâ€”it's about humans working with AI. This project explores new paradigms for collaboration between human creativity and artificial intelligence, creating workflows that leverage the strengths of both.\n\n## Research Areas\n\n### 1. Creative Collaboration\n- **Design Partnerships**: AI as a creative collaborator in design processes\n- **Content Creation**: Human-AI teams producing multimedia content\n- **Problem Solving**: Combining human intuition with AI analysis\n\n### 2. Analytical Workflows\n- **Data Analysis**: AI handling routine analysis while humans focus on interpretation\n- **Research Acceleration**: AI-powered literature review and synthesis\n- **Decision Support**: AI providing insights for human decision-making\n\n### 3. Learning and Education\n- **Personalized Learning**: AI tutors adapting to individual learning styles\n- **Skill Development**: AI-assisted training and skill assessment\n- **Knowledge Discovery**: AI helping humans explore new domains\n\n## Prototype Development\n\nWe're building working prototypes that demonstrate effective human-AI collaboration in various domains, from creative design to scientific research. These prototypes serve as both research tools and examples of what's possible.\n\n## Future Vision\n\nOur goal is to create a future where AI enhances human capabilities rather than replacing them, leading to more fulfilling and productive work experiences for everyone."
